Speaker 1 

So I mean, Speaking of the bank guarantee, so at the moment we are handling or there of 1 Stockholm showroom is done, we just need to get the final confirmation from the landlord saying that they received the deposits we transferred and then after the showroom because we signed the LOI. So which we are already. Like with the NT, Netherland, and ICBC, so Bank of China to prepare the internal process, but we are waiting for the final contract. To really to. Issue the bank guarantee and then headquarter. I am lack of information there so as soon as we get the. At least a. Draft kind of lease agreement. We could already start talking to the banks to prepare the internal process and then last one is the Stockholm Service center. Because we signed the contract, I think last month, but there we only said it was said that we need to transfer the deposit. So they are at the moment talking to the landlord. Whether we could change this with the bank guarantee. So these are the four things. Yeah. For things that are. Ongoing regarding the bank guarantee. 

Speaker 2 

OK, so we need. To let each headquarter contract assignment if we can. OK then hour. 

Speaker 4 

One pager to summarize the. Basically the yes, almost on all the. OK, we're gonna. Elaborate in our part, we have a separate question. 

Speaker 2 

OK. All right. 

Speaker 4 

For each other. 

Speaker 2 

And then purchasing. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, we will have alignment meeting. 

Speaker 5 

Today. So how is the? 

Speaker 3 

Already regarding the especially the content, currently the logistic, the term connections and also the details. 

Speaker 6 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

So we we do this. Yeah, before we send out the article send out, we will. We have our target almost aligned like the timing, but the content still. In the in this week and. Next week, we really need to. Align no matter we have the conditions. If we have very, very high level description. To you know how to communicate with all the potential those different effects. 

Speaker 2 

This is the. 

Speaker 3 

Set so we will not know that. 

Speaker 7 

Part of the meeting this afternoon and this is. 

Speaker 3 

We will have. 

Speaker 2 

And this is cars or cars and parts, right? OK. And when remind me, because we had the discussion on that, when do? We want to wrap this by. Was in June. 

Speaker 3 

We we want to wait 27. 

Speaker 2 

What's week 27? 

Speaker 6 

Or something like this. 

Speaker 8 

Should be sent out this week. And then we have another month and a half something around that to. 

Speaker 3 

Come to a decision. 

Speaker 2 

And the the. The P cards. Where did they arrive to POK? Yeah, yeah. 

Speaker 8 

Which are coming now they are. They are going all through Cebu. 

Speaker 2 

All through Zeebrugge. And then process. By what Lincoln called you know they're. 

Speaker 8 

Going to save it. 

Speaker 2 

So they're just going to get loaded and loaded. 

Speaker 9 

Traditional traditional spirals like we had so far, so they go through several several cars the car. And we are. Asking to to make all the efforts up to key ends for the test drive. 

Speaker 2 

For this activity in seven. Who will who will do the prepping of the vehicle? Who will physically do it? 

Speaker 8 

The The seven guys. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah, no, sorry. Wrapping the preparation on the vehicle for for journalists that this is the question, correct? 

Speaker 2 

The the the 15 PP cars that are driving. Who is doing the prepping of the cars in seven? 

Speaker 9 

Yes, is the team of server. I had a meeting last Friday with the responsible because class that is responsible now moves to China for four months. So basically, Marie is responsible. This activity very much clarified that we want the car taken from the port to prepare preparation complete so means. Complete test drive for journalists 7 did not do so far this activity so completely so means the key lands to journal. So basically what I ask, Marie is to check with all the engineering and also Ralph has been informed about this one. So that from all engineering side will be expert by area, OK and we will receive the car a few days before the 28th to be ready to be driven by journalists. 

Speaker 2 

Do we do we have or do we need the BSR for this activity? 

Speaker 9 

Yeah, we do need the BSR for these activities. 

Speaker 2 

So that's going to be prepped. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah, yeah, this will be. Let us understand the details I asked to make a quotation and so on, but definitely on one hand, I said, please go ahead. Don't stop because you know they were saying, OK, maybe we we are. We are never done. We we cannot. We need to wait for BSR so. He said no. Please go ahead. Start involving all the relevant stakeholders because we need a few engineers involved and then we will prepare the BSR. 

Speaker 6 

And that's that, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, but no BSR, no movement here. That needs to get done relatively quickly then. 

Speaker 9 

OK, so I asked, preparing the BSR. To be it. For no problem. 

Speaker 2 

So then beyond the BSR, because here you're talking about the preparation for the vehicles, for the the media event end of June, right. Now after the media event, the idea. Is maybe some Rd. shows or things? Like this. Is that correct? 

Speaker 8 

We are preparing now with that. What they're doing with these 15 cars exactly after the event. So the mark and as so the countries also putting in the input now, it's not that not yet there but this. Will be the. Case and of course, Benoit influenza. Whatever he needs. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

The next but, but you're going to need to think about who's. Providing Technical Support. 

Speaker 8 

This is what? We so far said we will, we will because I was 7. Until we have. 

Speaker 6 

OK, so so. 

Speaker 9 

This is I don't have a. Plan a lot on the other side, we. We need to be flexible. I understand we will be very flexible just to draft me. I ask people to start preparing the PSR so Benoit will give it a part of journalists. A lot of just high level what? They need to. Do so they can. We can have a it's important here to reserve the people. So just the people then at the concrete lab activity where? And so on. We can do at a. Later stage I will ask. 

Speaker 2 

But you need. To be Alex, Alex, Alex. Remember, remember that potentially you're talking about planning test drive events. I don't know the details, but during vacation period here as well. Is that correct? 

Speaker 8 

So far we haven't put any time plan. Now we have the idea, but we have not. 

Speaker 2 

So so you need to factor that in. Right. The potential that. That will the people be. Available and so on and where. Do you need these? People because Seve is. 20 minute drive from here, right? So if you're doing an event in Stockholm, a test drive event in or in Amsterdam, or I don't know where, is there a technician there or not there? 

Speaker 7 

And and so that. 

Speaker 2 

Or how is it going? To work, so you need to you need to lock these things down. That if it's through. If it's through Sept, then the BSR needs to be prepared accordingly to factor that. In or you need to consider third party support. 

Speaker 8 

We have to. 

Speaker 9 

So just to to to make a point that you know we we are doing the clinics this week in Germany and we have several. People in Germany. So the point is, is an agreement with the server is that if we policy with the with the you know where the people need to be and so on with some advance like a few weeks in. Advance they can also provide the people all around the even. 

Speaker 2 

OK, let's, let's. 

Speaker 9 

Of course we need. To plan, we need to plan, OK? Appear that we initiated the PSR and within the PSR we will have to where one is a journalist one after journalist. And we can clarify this, OK. 

Speaker 8 

But just to we agree that server is running. That was what we have been. Discussing earlier that they are. Taking care of the cars now. The next weeks or months, if we need Technical Support, another country, maybe we have another solution, but that they provide these management of cars and. 

Speaker 11 

So this is a clear this is. 

Speaker 9 

A clear but. If you after the event, if we want them to act. As a spiral C. We need to tell them. 

Speaker 8 

Yeah, absolutely. OK. 

Speaker 3 

And maybe then. 

Speaker 1 

Just one question, just one question. Have we or had they already produced the P cards or is this already on the way? 

Speaker 9 

I don't know is a is a lot are is ending. We need to ask Andy actually. 

Speaker 8 

Are on 15th of April have been? 

Speaker 7 

Produced, produced OK. 

Speaker 8 

And they're now on the way, arriving 15th of may, up to 20th of May. Of the cars and then some. 

Speaker 1 

Oh, OK, let me. I can check with. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah, I think it's let's do one thing. We include the in in the executive report, lot are on Friday. So we know exactly where the car are. If there is any issue, OK. 

Speaker 6 

OK. 

Speaker 9 

And for patches for purchasing. 

Speaker 6 

Right. 

Speaker 9 

Sorry, I have a point. If when he's finished the the point. 

Speaker 8 

Go, go, go. 

Speaker 9 

OK, so my point is that what we are doing, Simon, for one, there are two aspects here, the TSP, CMP, this is a quite relevant cost per car that as we said, we must avoid target has been provided to you. So I would. Like I understand that. We had the meeting with the CEO so would be good to update also Spiros. For me the most important is. What is the next step? As I said, any day that we lose in the negotiation, this goes against us, OK? I don't want to have. Then the the point that we go towards a a target with a lower amount achieved like we did for Mino and then you know Spiros is saying Alex why you did not push for it. So I don't want to add. So please update us on this second point related to one that it is a business side. I'm not happy at all our one full business has been set up in Europe. This is a business they can do. It's a very basic business as a very like help desk or help customer. I don't think we want to become a software based company with such a kind of a basic understanding. So within this week I start already. Scanning of part of our connectivity. So I scanned the weeks I scan the. The end of the testing and the third one I want to scan the one I will do with external company this week is the first one that comes. I will do in 2-3 weeks with another one and I will do another one as well. So from one side there is a quite a passive approach. Again, I would like to understand from a contractual point of view. How we are going to move because in case the one who is sleeping, we escalate into the management and then we are free to to enlarge the business. Of course with the business needs. 

Speaker 11 

So those are the. 

Speaker 2 

Don't think we do. A contract or an SLA signed with Kung Fu. 

Speaker 3 

From my understanding, the China team, the SNC, when we had this information improves, there is only development contract, there is nothing there operating contract or delivery agreements between us. So everything to me is it seems we we were not involved. It should be. Two years ago. So then. Everything is we we need. To race down and buy ourselves. 

Speaker 5 

That's why why we we were so struggling, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

But we need we need to move on this very quickly, right? Yeah. Because we need. We need not only not only the contract from an SLA perspective, right, which is part of Alex's issue. We also need the contract to understand where the liability lies. Yeah, because of course, of course. 

Speaker 12 

And also things like warranty and things as well. 

Speaker 2 

But that we can package within maybe SLA? In some sense. But I I don't want to carry Juan Fool's liability, right? If somebody on their side leaves a server unlocked. I don't think that's our. Should be on our back and I have no intention of carrying their liability at all. Right, so that we need to carefully assess. I don't know what the the process is, but we need to clarify that ideally this week, what's the process to get? To the contract. 

Speaker 9 

Yeah, that is a spirit of this is a for me. Very urgent because one side we need to unleash these TSP. So we need to agree on the rate. So there is the money, OK. So we have €4.00 per market. This is a far above any logic. And the second point is indeed as as service level agreement. Play and so. And then we understand how they want to set up the business. From my first. Talk to Andre already to meeting with the CEO of 1 for Europe. Actually they they set up a business in a very supportive way. So if customer data is needed, if there is any customer, let's say inconvenient, they intervene. So it's very let's say reactive. OK. So if there is an issue, they react. My point is with the data customer data we can do many things. So in, of course respect in GDPR and and so on. And it seems that they don't have the competency to do so. Also, in China they do all the marketing activity. So I think once we understand the contract really what is the link with them and the? Development with SNC that have been done for the TSP. We move the step forward and say how will this data we will do business. So that's why for me, it's important to have a contract for a financial point of view, but also to start thinking and planning what we want to do with the connectivity. So that's why it's the key for me, Simon, this, please. 

Speaker 3 

Understood. Understood. So. Yeah, I I I made the ocean. So he agreed to do we continue to talk to the new leaders. So they will send a new to you. Here and I already talked to to her. She's a lady, so let's continue. So, Alex, we we we talk offline. I I understand, but for sure we will make sure that this year the short term delivery and and for the for the cycle life, the warnings we must have. The middle term or less? 

Speaker 2 

We need a we need a clear contract with him so I know and I want this locked down quickly because because as Alex said, every day that passes is in their favor because we're a hostage. 

Speaker 7 

No, no, no. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, we're a hostage. It's that simple. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, we will. I it's it's, it's. To me, it's. Then we we. We involve the two like, to be honest, it's it's the China team SNC 5 days. 

Speaker 2 

But we are. Yeah, but we are. We are where we are. 

Speaker 3 

They only care about the ID, then they they didn't take the operating. 

Speaker 

We are where? 

Speaker 2 

We are so now we need to develop a strong contract. With these guys right from a from a server. 

Speaker 3 

So and also just for. Information for those just solution platform, so we must align with maybe with other brother companies. It's also the biggest. The chance to share the cost, especially for the operating cost that will service smart and 216 also so. And I will organize this. This holding family companies only only seeker Europe. The the volume. Maybe it's too, too, too small to share. 

Speaker 5 

So yeah, I I I. 

Speaker 3 

I understand the situation then then. I then we take the. 

Speaker 2 

All right. So Alex, Alex. 

Speaker 9 

OK. Yeah, put it is not on on, on Friday on this one, OK. So we can update also speed also where we OK because I would like really to move forward. 

Speaker 2 

I don't think sorens not here. 

Speaker 14 

OK. Any, any. 

Speaker 2 

Topics on legal related topics, so anybody wants to raise now or. 

Speaker 14 

Yes, from yeah now from my side, I will I have a meeting this afternoon with Soren, but. I have a. Number of topics that needs to be quickly finalized. With contract with different agencies because it's pending. So I will update if there is any further kind of delay. But I have a number of topics to be quickly finalized. 

Speaker 2 

Is there one list of open items that we have with? Or maybe it's part of a? Bigger master list of things that are pending on legal side contracts, NDA's or whatever. 

Speaker 8 

What I'm working is on a list with the join us where legal is kind of benefiting from that. What are the open? Purchase request now it should be already since last week on a shared folder. It's not yet, but I think I don't know if you are part of that discussion, but this will be a kind of what are the pending topics and where is it stuck and also. 

Speaker 2 

But that's fine if something has gone to PR. If something has gone to PR then. You should be. Tracking it step by step, right and legal. Is one of those steps. Should be. It should be. The but there are items. That are pre PR. Like an NBA, you don't have to be in PR to to send an NBA, so I don't know if you have that, but it would be good to have a an overview of all open items. 

Speaker 8 

This is another. 

Speaker 2 

That we have with legal. 

Speaker 8 

And especially the the. Top of the. New companies and so on, where we now going. Into the rollout plan. There's no PR beforehand, and there are a lot of things to. Yeah, financial services are sent already. A list of their, I don't know, 10s of contracts. Regarding products regarding customer products, our topics, Jane, you are involved. In most of them. 

Speaker 2 

But this Georgina. Is working on yes, yeah. 

Speaker 8 

But there's there's a long list of non PR. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, but that's my point. Yeah, the PR one should be followed through the purchasing process, right? But the other ones? Fall through the cracks or potentially fall through the cracks, so we should lose sight of. 

Speaker 1 

So I think I think from my side like two things are quite critical and urgent. One is I shared with you first last week that together with Lauren and Ming Chen, we are reviewing all the AOA and. On holding an EUV and on national sales entity level, so this we have a follow up tomorrow afternoon. So within this week we hope. That we finalize the 1st. Just for all the entities and second thing is very urgent which I also I directly address to Ming Chen. So asking her to support from headquarters site directly as the general distributor agreement. So basically sales contract with the headquarter headquarter and you. Because now I see that for example I want to. Lock the exchange rate. For purchasing the vehicle and so on, where all. The banks are asking. For kind of this agreement and also for other usages as well. So I asked Ming Chen last week whether she could directly support this from headquarter because they are also one party as well. So these tools are very urgent, but all I already. Histamine, 10 and Soren. For this video, I think I will. The only thing I didn't. Share is the. I think we need this within this month because. Then I think the surfing. 

Speaker 2 

I think I think. Yeah, I'm not going to a board meeting. If we don't have this in place. 

Speaker 1 

You you want. 

Speaker 2 

What I'm not, I'm not. 

Speaker 1 

You don't come to have that meeting. 

Speaker 2 

How am I going to do a board meeting that I'm supposed to do this month? No, the holding needs a board meeting this month. 

Speaker 5 

Right. 

Speaker 1 

You are you are you talking about the? AOA or are you talking about the? 

Speaker 2 

I'm talking about that the. I'm not doing a board meeting if we don't have in place the master Master distribution agreement for us. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, I think, look, I think that's like. Fairly speaking, we need a template in the 1st place, but a lot of things in that contract needs to be adjusted and aligned among business, finance and legal altogether. I think we don't have a baseline that's the issue. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, but you can fix those in the appendix the master level. The agreement, the framework agreement. Could be done very, very quickly, right? 

Speaker 1 

I can follow up on this together with starting with. Headquarter on legal side. 

Speaker 2 

And the other entertainment agreements, right? 

Speaker 1 

And third, sorry. 

Speaker 2 

And the other intercompany agreements? 

Speaker 10 

Some of them are now in the. 

Speaker 3 

Signal breakfast so we can. 

Speaker 2 

Well, there he is. There he is there. He is. There is. 

Speaker 10 

So we have an alignment already on that topic, that's good, but in general, I'm going to also have, as Jane already mentioned. Tomorrow, but may change, and with her also alignment, because there is more likely 6070 percentage not covered which you just mentioned which needs. 

Speaker 5 

To be in place. 

Speaker 10 

But there's a lot that needs to be done only from corporate point of view. 

Speaker 2 

OK, but we need to move quickly now, guys on these points, right, we. Can't be discussing. 

Speaker 10 

Yes, but I I just want to emphasize that I asked already 2 weeks ago now. Today I saw that it's not on the topic for purchasing. We need urgently also, that consultant on board, because Georgina is not. Able to cover. All those topics that's now on top. So if and again. Regina is doing a lot. Even more than that, we are paying for her at the moment. But I see already. A clear leakage of legal support for. All the projects. That is now on the. 

Speaker 1 

Soren, I suggest that you, me, Ming Chen as first week together. Look into the overall resource and corresponding plan altogether. I also checked with I I checked the contract numbers and 1st I checked the contract with Clarence and I know that now. Is on board. But these are the resources that you are having at the moment, but on the other side, on the other hand, I also see like Lima is not since like not directly working on bigger topics anymore, so I think. 

Speaker 10 

No, she was never been intended to do so. Clearly handling that. And there I already need 1 addition. Resource only percent not Ms. Is not the topic for you. 

Speaker 1 

What I'm saying is that let's review all the resources you have and all the things that you need to do together with what the birds and birds and and Clarence has done in the past two months, what they have been working on, what have been delivered so that we know in the long run what resources exactly you need. 

Speaker 10 

Happy to lose again. 

Speaker 2 

But let and let's do that quickly, guys, because there's no time. To waste right? 

Speaker 15 

And then corporate updates for me. 

Speaker 2 

Corporate update for me, no, I don't. I don't have anything particular to share this week. I'm going to Israel on Wednesday to sign. The MO. U for Israel the distribution right. And I'm doing that. On behalf of Andy, which will be handled through Mars team in China, so we don't need to worry about it. I don't know. Soren, if you heard anything back from being Chen regarding the POA. 

Speaker 10 

I had today in the morning already a conversation with Leon. I'm still waiting for an answer. So he already mentioned that he would prioritize it during the day because I. 

Speaker 6 

OK. 

Speaker 10 

Needed first to to check myself. 

Speaker 2 

OK.
