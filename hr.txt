Speaker 4 

OK. Then I jump into. HR update then we have this specific session. A little bit. Of it regarding. The deliverables in April. We reviewed these affections three 3-4 weeks ago. We have made quite good. Progress so far, I would say the first. Organization, structure and key roles and recruitment planning so far, with the trees gone on board, I think she has been on dialogue with all of you setting up regular meetings to sort out the key roles to be higher than priorities. And so I think that that's going fine now and our recruiters are very much ramping up their speed to cope with your requirement. Hopefully we're fine for the time being. The second cluster, that is the readiness for the hiring and employment. In the Netherlands, we made quite good progress that we have locked down the pension solution we have get to the formal contract ready and the payroll solutions and so on. It's very much done now we are waiting for the final son of the engagement letter, but they are already working on that since more paperwork to be sorted out the sponsorship. This is very much supporting the work permit application and it will take much longer time. So we did prioritize a little bit for. April and we can kick off the. Exercise in May with the. The last bucket is so much focus on the recruitment. We accept each our team entries. We sort out, sort out the new recruiting process. 

Speaker 1 

Which is much. 

Speaker 4 

More faster now. I hope that you feel that and also we have weekly recruitment. Starting from this week. Sophie Markinson will generate this report and send over to all of you on. 

Speaker 11 

A weekly basis. 

Speaker 4 

When it comes to LinkedIn, cheers. Would you like to give updates to leadership team regarding linking? 

Speaker 16 

Finally, I think one day ago my score is final. The the contract, which means that now we have a global linking solution in place, meaning that we will have thicker global linking with unlimited job slots to post and. Unlimited recruiters, which for recruiting hiring activities and also for PR activities. We have the live page. We can create freely, even we have, furthermore, with the US, China and the Eastern Pacific other, I mean company are all for free. And we can. Share this resources but what I would like to have potential maybe from youth girls and learn wise regarding our. PR updates of the company news within the Zinker company hub. I mean zipper global one not the Zika U1 because currently we don't really have any PR person looking after this and as far as I understood Christian now she she approached the PR China to. As for help, since so far we don't have anyone who intends to to do this, and if this is the case, then eventually we may have a lot of things under you, but nothing on deeper, you know? Well, I don't know PR we have this discussion, furthermore, or I mean with HQ perspectives. I would recommend that maybe. And why you can talk with Steven Spine to have some solution on that, I mean at least we are also have having this kind of responsibility to stretch and seeker as a global brand, just update from here. 

Speaker 4 

OK. And then the last progress is? Regarding the temporary solution. For micro those people that has no you working for. It's still ongoing, but so far think big hustles are cleared out. Already from each. Perspective, we are very much up to the speed. Just give you a little bit quick status report regarding recruitment. Chris, would you like? To take on this part. 

Speaker 16 

No, that was I think there was basically not. Up to date we are. Going to optimize this format, what you are seeing here is the status based on the pipeline position. Report instead of the candidate profile. I think Wednesday PM meeting. We are going to update this where you will see all of the CV quantities to be reviewed, be interviewed or contract signed. So that's basically the start of that update here. 

Speaker 4 

But this report will be released to all of you starting from this week. You can look into the details beyond the data behind. Any questions, please feel free to reach out to. OK. Then I prepared 2 pager. Just to give you the high. Level from each perspective. Last week I had a very short exchange with a lot of time to understand the upcoming. Than see ramping up plan for our markets basically for the time being, we have at least five stores in the pipeline to open up. Then assuming that we have 6 to 8 months lead time. To prepare, store then HR we will have to get all the contract. Set up ready at least half year before that, so this is quite the lesson learned exercise we have done with the Netherland. It takes much longer time than we thought from. Beginning but at. Least last two. I would say. Two months we have built very thorough knowledge now how to set up kind of salary set up contracts. Payroll set up and so on, and giving exercise we have done with the remaining countries will be much easier from our point of view, but still it takes time. We have divided all the preparations into 3 phases. The highway ready, meaning all the collective agreement with the unions, employment contract, pay structure and those payroll solutions on the highs to the lows even for the fuel card same card, those minor issues. If you don't really have. We're gonna constantly be. Changed by the candidate and so on. So we we are now setting up a very structured working HR team who will be doing what that office for swimming team. They're very much responsible for all the policies and structures, processes and. To make sure the solution will be. Ready. And then? Team is more focusing on the recruitment. Practical things to carry. Out, so hurry. Ready. Make make sure like freaking set up before. The end of this month. This month all the solution has to be in place before we're sending from the contract on board ready. That means the office premises orientation program as we did last Wednesday. I hope that. Found it useful for. New employees and also system set up by medical services would be in place and last phase will be. It's more detailed insurance, for example, not mandatory, but some benefits suppliers and tourist place and so on. So with these three phases deployment plan. Entire HR team is very. Much ready to deploy and all that exercises. Are not going already. 

Speaker 8 

Eight months would be the time frame where the first tires on board, which shows kind of four months, five months maybe, which is not enough because the first hire will start to set everything up and then received. Now we're doing it all in parallel and we are really coming into a phase where it's. Not really structured and well to come. 

Speaker 4 

Understood, but let's try to lock down one country after another. Much under control. 

Speaker 8 

Yeah, I'm talking about the future ones now that we're talking Germany. That's why we are now on the way of hiring and for Germany, for for Norway, screening scenes and some this is the early, the better a year before is for me where we have a solid starting point. If we coming 8. Once it's getting already very tough. 

Speaker 4 

But we will have to synchronize with legal perspective as well because sometimes if we take command as a sample, does it really make difference when we read this? May last November. Or in March. Sometimes, even if you register the company very early, but if you don't really have any substance into that, it created the complexity for us to manage as well an employee for. For from HR perspective, labor. Law perspective without registered company wage, tax and finance payments. And ability ready. We cannot send informal contract, so there is some communication there. 

Speaker 8 

I understand that's why I said. Maybe the idea. That that takes over a project from the headquarter perspective. Being a couple of months on the. Headquarter payroll and employee employment contract. And then moving once. The company is then I just say first on board is really almost main. Starting point to figure the area. 

Speaker 10 

But let's discuss this. A little bit further because. Even on the labor law, if you provide in a contract, you need always content from the employees to moving them to another entity, even if you are engaging. So that is not so easy and. It needs to be prepared. Very properly, because if something is changing. And for whatever reason, the person is not agreeing to it. Then we are running. Into an issue. 

Speaker 4 

And all the terms and conditions we define in the internal contract has to have solid grounds. 

Speaker 13 

Just give them some. 

Speaker 4 

Empty commitments, you know, especially for. Retention, for example. We now realize, OK, without any CBA in Sweden, we will not be able to give informal contract. That's the reality. But I would say let's try to find a good balance in the future. The business update is very much important for, for HR and finance and legal to be prepared otherwise like Paris, you say next May. That will be the time to launch the store and we have to to know get to know that at least 6 to 8 months prior to that activity. So keep us updated and then we. Can be much better prepared. 

Speaker 2 

What's the recruitment plan in concretely? You know, I understand hiring the head of. The head of the country between brackets. But what is the recruitment plan, both in terms of sales and after sales? For the teams on the ground for. 

Speaker 8 

It should be that. Much more earlier because. Then after the head is there, it's going step by. Step forward right now. It's all in parallel. We're increasing already somehow. The team is preparing job descriptions, but. As it's not get on board. For Sweden and we opened in August. And then there's the mess right now. 

Speaker 12 

So we we sort of got interviews as well for the for. Example the head. Of the workshop delivery centre, because we have to do that because obviously we need to get technicians, we need to get technicians trained in in time for opening and so on. So there are there are. Things that we have to. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, I I understand that guys. 

Speaker 12 

Do and just have? 

Speaker 2 

And I understand it'll be a little bit of a mess. In this one but. Here it says first on board and you said. I need that. A little bit earlier. But we should have a clear. What about the rest on board when I view? 

Speaker 8 

Yeah, we have. 

Speaker 15 

Does that happen? 

Speaker 8 

We have a clear road map which I've provided to you first on board and team on board and on. 

Speaker 5 

OK. All right. All right. 

Speaker 8 

That's there and that's why I said eight months. Is a minimum. 

Speaker 10 

And let's look. 

Speaker 8 

Into. I understand the risk. I don't provide any solution because I'm not an expert. I just say if we don't have the person on board everything. Lacks on quality I mean. Looking for the location and the truth now? To be honest. Location in the South of Stockholm where now? Says this is 1. Of the worst locations in the surrounding of Stockholm in terms of traffic and purchase power, these quality is. Something we should not. Have put as a risk. If we're just hiring 3-4 months earlier. 

Speaker 12 

Yeah, I mean the other thing for me is, I mean it, it's fine for kind of the store and the delivery centres, we've sort of got a plan for that. It's at what point we then start migrating sort of more MSC tight back up at that point and I don't think we've kind of got agreement yet on on where we do that. So for example, mobile service do. They report into the. Dot port to the report and to NSC and the. When we start talking about warranted Technical Support, so I think to start with we can base these people at the handover delivery centers. But again, we kind of need to know and agree how we grow that NFC structure, which is a slightly longer term than obviously operating the delivery center. 

Speaker 6 

Now that's clear, OK. 

Speaker 4 

Then there is another short term exercise. We're going to. Keep up very, very soon this. Is regarding the necessary location. Plan referring to the people that going to move. Amsterdam and also the people from Sept to Amsterdam, but also some new newcomers like Vortech and anti. You guys going to move from other countries to understand as well we sort out this relocation plan just. To give you. A heads up many. Activities going to carry out starting from now the first string this relocation plan is only one item on. The plan, but if you break. Down to activities, at least 4. Streams has to be carried out in parallel. One stream, this orange one that is regarding the. And last weekend this week, I'm going to continue to check with all of you what is your plan, your family's plan to move over to Amsterdam and so on to conclude the name list and with the timeline that, that would be the number one. Exercise we need to. Do in parallel. We're going to give you some tax implications and briefing. Some, like external partners to give you some information regarding what does it mean for you and your family moving from Sweden or whatever to see them and. I will continue to work on the contract preparation because now you have to move your contract into either holding or they can assess in Amsterdam we will have. To rebuild some of the. Terms and conditions in parallel, hopefully by the end of May or beginning of June, we will get all your contract ready for the. So the first group of people that will be ready. To move will be. September 1st according to our plan now. And there will be second group like Steve. We we don't really. The sponsorship then we cannot help you. To answer them, for example, that would. Be the second wave in January, hopefully in January, we will be able to move. You over to them. So we do. Need to divide people in at least two or three sessions I see will be another group when I sponsorship is ready I see some non European citizens. 

Speaker 8 

Must be a group or can this be? 

Speaker 4 

It can be scattered, it can be scattered, but micro. 

Speaker 2 

We're not going all. On the same thing, it's not like we're, it's. 

Speaker 12 

With that bag. 

Speaker 2 

Not like we're renting a bus. 

Speaker 4 

But there there is nothing better than deadline to drive those activities. 

Speaker 7 

OK. 

Speaker 4 

So my ambition is. Since we have this board meeting upcoming board meeting, but also the legal requirements for the holding to have real substance, we have to lock down all those all those activities in May. So my ambition is we try to conclude all the contract by the end of May and then we move. People with this time that suits you best. Like HR, that deadline is 1st of September. Everything has to be ready. For people to. The second stream, our home ready referring to the people that will have to relocate to Amsterdam. This is very hectic and very constrained real estate market. We have learned quite a lot from different relocation services and suppliers. It's a long lead time for anyone to find some proper. Of apartment or house in Amsterdam. What we're going to do, I've already come to. We have already had discussion. With the GBC so. This is gonna step. In something from this week to book separate. Meeting with you to understand your individual requirements. How many people? Will move at one and what kind of terms and conditions when I'm going to say here we have to find. A good balance because the. The real estate market is pretty hectic. As I said, it's very expensive compared to Sweden set up as well. We're coming back to our finance, our. CFO is sitting online. We need to find the right balance one part. Is what you. Wish to have another balance is what we can look forward from a company perspective. So there is there will be some. Balance in between. To be cleared. Out, but relocation policies in place we. Just need to refund. 

Speaker 

A little bit. 

Speaker 4 

And get it approved by Zika headquarter. And then in two weeks. Time we can communicate with all of you. Who is eligible? To what and how we can? So this is about home ready. Which are going to continue to work on the policy, make it much clearer. And then Christine from DC going to retail to all of you to. Understand your wish. OK. That is the second string, third string. This is really big, assuming that our lease agreements will be done. The key I thought that we already get the key, but anyway. Well, assuming that you're. Going to close down this these agreements. One week or two weeks time we will have to kick off a big exercise to find a vendor to help with the renovations, furnitures. You know, that's empty office with the 2500 square meters. According to the marketplaces. To renovate size of 600 to 800 square meter, it takes 6 to 8 months. This is basically the vendors telling us we will have to be prepared for much longer lead time to be able to have. People on board. That's why we put 4th. Of November as a deadline. And latest we need to. Get our office ready 1st November. And before that, we need to have a living interim solution, temporary solution purchasing is helping us to close the deal with the rocking 75 for that. Five in Amsterdam, that's only 100 square meters. Maximum 15 to 20 people. But giving our ramp up plan. We need to have the nocturne solution in place. So purchase. Please help us. To ramp up your your team and make sure. This office will be runs. Immediately, in the meantime, internally we have to come come to agreement. Going to lead this. The project to get our office and headquarter ready. So if it's more comprehensive project, we can know. The last spring. It's sponsorship for. And non citizens, we can get some help from to keep it off. So it's more cost issue but also. Some vendors selection. So those are some. Plan in May, this activity has to be done in May. Most of the preparations and project. Setup has to be ready. Looking to make high level thinking along this for each other to carry out. There is one more task. This one is much Co related to legal part. The Seeker in your holding. In the past, we said, well, finances. We have not ready for payments. Informal contracts not ready people are not. Doing blah blah. We have lot of reason to put on hold the Zika holding operation, but starting from May almost everything is ready except the office. So what else? We can argue with the? Authority that we. We cannot have our Managing Director afford or we we can't. Not much space left. For us to argue with authority. To be able to get this tax beneficial. So from our. Point of view, we're going to drive. Very hard holding heroes and appointments and contract. As I said, 15th of May. That would be my deadline to lock down for. Example, the contract for her. Regardless, when you're going to move but. Contract has to be ready very soon. Jennifer, we had a team. We believe the high level concept, which responsibility lies in you hand holding and which part of responsibility and roles through being MSS for corporate functions. Now we come to very good. Alignment on the HR I'm. Going to brief. Later today, but that will be one of the example. All other functions needs to do the same legal, finance, purchasing. We have to do the same. Who? How? How many? People and responsibilities and confidence will be setting. Holding level and the rest will be the message level. This is very much important as well. With those two input the holding key roles and. Contract in place with the. The work sleep between holding and. Access in place. Now we have much sorrow. Input to the board meeting to take decisions there. And then in parallel, that's more ongoing exercise the substructure the key roles for MSS 3 is going to continue to have dialogue with you. But we need to lock down this structure account number and costs for personnel costs into each. There is no more time to be. Played around on this topic, so the first cluster is very important top priority for your team. The second cluster that is regarding the to refine the current setup for the Netherlands setup reduction plans, asset pension supplier, we only have pension solution in place. But who gonna pay the pension for us? Who will be our partner? Some practical things. And office and. The third cluster, this is very much to prepare the employment of the Sweden because Sweden company this one is ongoing. It doesn't really take that much effort, but. Still, legal ground has to. Be there, we can't promise will come on the contract to anyone. Before the CBA is in. But please finance and legal. This company will be up and running around mid. Of May or at latest end. Otherwise we won't be. Able to apply any. Collective bargaining agreements with unions. So those are the prerequisites for us to run the company. The last part is not really so urgent, but I do understand we need some clarity like travel policy and company called Policy which takes a little bit effort from finance and legal purchasing as well when it comes to company cards such company card policy, it's not really applicable for that and we are getting some support from the call. Than now, but more and more people. Coming to the stage, for example, can they have benefits instead of company car if, let's say besides company car, what else to be offered? This is more is that fleet set up or it's private company car set up obviously in Netherlands this is completely different setup compared to Sweden. So more investigation has to be. Give this task to legal finance, so let's come. Up with a little bit. Tangible proposal who are eligible. The car, which is pretty expensive and who will be eligible to the fleet, the carpool for example for the company and who will not be eligible to that at all and they can borrow or lease whatever set up we. Can have, so those are some. Practical things to be further knocked down by some functions together. 

Speaker 8 

Just the question we're driving in your. Team is company. Policy that we. 

Speaker 4 

Can for the time being, everything is on my shoulder. But I think I can take lead to book meeting to kick off and then let's say we can. The right fit for this one set to HR team is totally burnt out by all the exercise. That's why we're ramping up the MSHR now, very promising. We got two good candidates. Hopefully one of them can take on this one. OK, I'm done anything. You want to add on? 

Speaker 16 

Hello this guy comment, please go ahead. 

Speaker 8 

OK. I just have one question as we are now having mark already on board as this coming soon, the team is getting on board. How, when will they have their offices? Once they're on board in Stockholm, should we look for these places now as? Steve and myself. Or who's taking care of that? Answer then probably we can use. Our headquarter at the beginning and. How will all these say? Contract support and. So on executed in in which way so? Just to understand how this entire entity and and physical location. Will be organized now the next month. 

Speaker 4 

You mean the office? 

Speaker 8 

The spaces plus all the facilities. 

Speaker 4 

We will have to take on that. I only considered HR part, but if I thought that. We would not have so many people in this Stockholm. We planned 2030. 

Speaker 8 

I mean right now, I mean we always. Said we are. Starting out of the store and this will be. Probably the 1st. Month the case. But I mean there will be an ordering, a planner. 

Speaker 2 

You'll need an office space for the Sweden team, not the store team. 

Speaker 13 

In Stockholm, you need a product leader for entire facility management then. 

Speaker 2 

No, but yeah, yeah. I don't know. If we can use, if there's any way to use? 

Speaker 8 

I was also thinking that, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

There's office space there and the. Upstairs is something that we could take. A little bit. 

Speaker 12 

We yeah, we we could talk to them and see what's available, couldn't we because we're we're not, we're not renting anything on the top floor at the moment, but there is. 

Speaker 7 

Short term or below. At the beginning. 

Speaker 8 

I don't know. The only point for me. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, but it's not kitted out, so they have nowhere to sit. They'll be building. If it's fixed then. Yes, but OK, let's look at that, but yes. This is something. We're we're going to face that in every. Country. So we need to. 

Speaker 8 

Have our money and for the upcoming country and additional questions. Not urgent, but just we have it on the agenda because we are talking now to many people on where. Will be the entity be. I mean for maybe in no way. It's easy to answer, it will be. Not slow for. Germany it's not so easy. France, you know, we've also not seen France I. Think we need to think about it already. That we give an indication. To the people. 

Speaker 4 

Not indication to certainty. 

Speaker 8 

At the beginning it's an indication, but yeah. It would be if we can say, look if you take over a position and Zika, Germany. Then you will have. To move to. 

Speaker 12 

Lord, come up against that one. 

Speaker 2 

No, no, no. We have to be. We have to be transparent and and and as Joe said, it's not maybe should be could be. I mean we. Need to tell people this is where the officers will be, even if they're not ready. I mean, at least you know, the officers will be in Dusseldorf or they'll. Be in Frankfurt or Berlin. 

Speaker 6 

Right, big thing. 

Speaker 2 

Just one last point HR Wise, Joe. In that matrix that you had of pipeline and so on and so forth, there's a couple of areas that we need to look at. Void Tech is on the call, so we need to have that chat with Voytek to see that team, how we start ramping that team up, and Destin, I've already spoken to, she's. Going to be, you know, she's got Aiden and maybe you know one more or whatever she's going to need. I can discuss that with her. And then the big mystery, which is the digital DC Europe. Right. So with I think with Voytek and with this being I'm not too concerned we can have that discussion together and see how we how we build those teams out. I am more concerned with the digital site. I've been saying this for months to. DC and to. Everybody. How many? People love roles. You know, it's like a broken record now, right? We need to lock this down because if all of these, the whole architecture, just hand it over and it's like, here you go. Now you have to support it from Europe, we might find ourselves in a very difficult situation. Right, so Sherise knows as well. I've had this discussion with her. We this this is not like we're we're it's not the Apollo mission, you know, it's not the Apollo space mission of we don't know what we're doing so. How many people are required to support those systems? There should be clarity in the next week or. Two that needs. To be locked down, because if we need to start recruiting in that area, IT people in the Netherlands, we need to know, right? 

Speaker 4 

All right. OK. Any other? Some extra requirement free chart. 

Speaker 12 

Just a quick operational 1, Joe, obviously the the guys that started last week, at what point do they start then migrating across to, I don't know, Netherlands expenses systems and concur and things at the moment. Presumably they're on CET. So we just, I just need to get the logins for that. But you've got from May in here, does that mean imminently then move across to a a conquer system in Netherlands or or do they stay with us at the moment? 

Speaker 4 

The temporary solution is to create temporary accounts for them under subsystem or separate is paying everything. But on in the meantime, you know success factor, HRC system and finance system, we have a deadline end of June to make sure our Zika MSS success factor system and travel system and so on ready by then. So before end. Of June, I believe we have to use this temporary solution, otherwise people cannot book flight tickets and they don't know how to how. To handle that. 

Speaker 12 

Exactly that again. 

Speaker 4 

I believe we have better. 

Speaker 1 

But this is. 

Speaker 4 

We need to keep off. Since three months saying basically for Netherlands. 

Speaker 15 

I have a question. 

Speaker 12 

That's fine. Thank you. 

Speaker 15 

I actually talked to it. They said that they can't use success factor and concur until July. 

Speaker 4 

On July now. 

Speaker 15 

Yeah, so it's a problem because they are now asking how to reimburse the expenses and they cannot do. 

Speaker 4 

That July, then, but July. 

Speaker 2 

So your point is. That in the meantime they can't reimburse expenses. 

Speaker 15 

Yeah, that's a. 

Speaker 

Problem, but it should be. 

Speaker 12 

Through conquer, as with us, I guess. 

Speaker 1 

Can I can I quickly share? I can quickly. Share from my side. I mean if Joe, if we are finalized with HR side because I could carry on a bit on the employment readiness part as well. 

Speaker 8 

Just one quick comment. Still for headquarter? Because I was. Not in anymore in the discussion, but that we don't miss on those that point assignment parking spaces. I don't know what the follow up. Of that, now we have been discussing when. We have been. In Amsterdam that we need additional parking spaces and I don't know if. Shown us and the team has really followed. I haven't heard anything about this. 

Speaker 2 

Because the headquarter has limited parking. And we said in the. Area we need to have additional parking. And is the are the parking spots across the? Across the flagship block now. 

Speaker 8 

Across the flagship in Amsterdam. Under the ground, yes, I. Think we have 8:00 but. 

Speaker 2 

Also to because I haven't seen anything that's. Right. 

Speaker 6 

OK. OK. Yeah, we'll look for that, OK. 

Speaker 2 

Go for it, Jane.
