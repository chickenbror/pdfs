Speaker 10 

And then one comment also from my side, because Jane already mentioned that some kind of rental or really the agreement should be signed and all the activities that we just discussed from an audit perspective, all of them needs to be covered in some kind of agreements which puts additionally legal. Support in addition to that as well from a corporate governance point of view, just wanted to emphasize this and we need also to this who is. 

Speaker 2 

But sorry, an agreement agreements between who and who. 

Speaker 10 

That's exactly the point. We need to understand. 

Speaker 6 

Who is providing? 

Speaker 10 

For example, loans to which company and then we can start to support in that regards to set it up, because that is for me not clear. Because it was just high level, now introduced and discussed. But we need to understand exactly who is providing to whom, what and the complexity as we are growing will be also just even between the secret you. 

Speaker 

Group is grow. 

Speaker 10 

Going and then if we are engaging GBC for specific services as we learn, if we don't have an agreement agreed in place and who is covering and distributing it then to the other entities, or should every entity sign up with GBC to get such support that needs to be clarified because then we can start to work and support with. 

Speaker 1 

And I think you are. Mentioning 2 things so. So basically the GPC conf. That's that's already at your disposal where it was initiated by Lima and Lima. Send it to Timothy today. So, I mean, you could have a look at it. I think we had this draft since 2. Weeks and then. 

Speaker 2 

And this is MSS. 

Speaker 16 

And on the other hand? 

Speaker 2 

This is the MSS level, right? This is MSN. This is Ms. Level agreement. The framework agreement with with MSUV. 

Speaker 1 

The whole thing, whole EU holding EUV. 

Speaker 5 

Hold it, hold it. 

Speaker 1 

I think it needs to include all the entities that newly. Signing contract with GDP. 

Speaker 2 

OK, so it's a framework. Agreement at holding level, covering all the entities underneath. Now 11. 

Speaker 1 

I think, yeah. No, I was. Echoing the second point, that sort of mentioned sort of, were you mentioning the intercompany loan just now that I just briefly mentioned exactly? Yeah, that is that we first need to like lock down the amount and then afterwards basically that's between the. Weaker Hong Kong, weaker Hong Kong and. EUV, so intercompany law needs to go to EUV. Capital injection is from Hong Kong to EU holding and then you're holding to UV. 

Speaker 2 

Do from a governance perspective, do we need to have that master master level agreement in place before the before the injection happens? 

Speaker 1 

We need an agreement for capital reduction. It's just kind of paper. We need to prepare. 

Speaker 2 

No, no, I know, I know, I know from. A governance perspective. Do we need the master level distribution agreement in place? Or does it matter or not? Before, it doesn't matter. 

Speaker 10 

That doesn't matter. That's two separate. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 10 

That's two separate. 

Speaker 1 

No, no, I, as I mentioned there were three parts. One is capital injection, which needs to be governed under VOD resolution. Second thing is the intercompany loan. Probably we need kind of the agreement like a loan agreement. And third thing is the payment term payment term we need to govern with this general distributor. So we have three resources of the loan on cash resources from headquarters, which needs to be governed under these three things, the resolution and intercompany financing loan and then the third one is general distributor agreement for the payment term. 

Speaker 6 

OK. 

Speaker 10 

Yes, you are right. But what Spiros mentioned is the master agreement that is an operational one which is. Independent from that that you just introduced. 

Speaker 2 

OK, very clear. 

Speaker 10 

That's why it's good. 

Speaker 2 

Clear, clear now. Final point, Jane. At at some point when you talked about expenses and all of these things, you talked about them at you mentioned a couple of times that UV right, UV, but. Remember that it also needs to cover the people who will have contracts in the holding if they need to do expense reports or whatever they're doing it through the holding. No, not through EUV. 

Speaker 1 

I mean at the. Moment when I discussed about the cash shortage or cash overall demand on Europe side. I didn't differentiate between the entities because if you say so, ultimately the national sales companies also need the expense. So I'm I'm more requesting now the overall like. 

Speaker 2 

No, no, no, no, no. I'm not talking about the money I'm talking about from a systems perspective. Right that we have to remember that we'll have employees that holding level so their their transactions will happen through holding right. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah, OK. Yes. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 

Oh, you mean. 

Speaker 5 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

OK, just update. On just inside the government process and also the. So yes, currently the from the money are the our stakeholders, especially the one also all the teams. Right. You are too quick. So now we receive an order. It's almost from last to last week we checked. We checked. It's 250. This is. Is in our highest 250. 

Speaker 2 

He said it's. 

Speaker 3 

Currently, yeah, the it's all the process are many processes and. Almost all the content is shorter terms, so the most agreement is is only valid for 6 to 12 months. So we we should we will have a second phase with the official sourcing almost longer terms especially. For all those services and the main areas, so currently we we see it's almost 80% at least we need to do the real sourcing. So currently it's only. Short solutions to make the deadline readiness. Yes, and all the process and timing critical we are and. Yeah, we, we. Work together and we still so very regarding our our our resources. So we added the three the unique app for the MSS. Where you have. It's five, is still is on ongoing. It's very difficult, it's it's in Sweden. So we understand all the, all the all the knowledge in other countries. So that's what we are struggling currently for sharing the current resources. And yes, it's. All the teams are struggling, so that's the status. We we have almost we, we we. Have this 250? Yeah, because it's it's on the outside. Every day is working on this. The correctable 1, so it's it's regarding the vector material aftermarket. And also regarding this growth. This is what we have the critical cases. The deal time of tending to the to the agreement, like Louis Armstrong had 1/4. So we will have this meeting together so. 

Speaker 10 

No, but but I can just confirm what you just said that if we're looking on this list and we're looking on the list, that is also from. And also then from HR and also what we talk about with Jane, I think all of us in the corporate needs to sit together. Bit and see what kind of resources we're having at the moment for support, because that's that. Overview I've prepared already. I have today also with much discussion of doing that. We need to consider this. Because that we will be coming or we already become a bottleneck to to meet the timelines. It's not unrealistic with that setup as we are running. Because just as an example. I need one fde which you have only for negotiating all the real estates, but whereas than the others and and I know. That that also. Purchasing and struggling at the moment very badly to cover everything in time because I'm also receiving that great contract that I know that I will discuss it today. I I just received it on Friday. 

Speaker 7 

To look into it. 

Speaker 10 

And we try to make it as much as possible, but here I think we we were creating a bottleneck. 

Speaker 7 

So that's why we we we we need to sit down maybe there. 

Speaker 3 

Every week, the times to to just align. The process so for user. Which one is all this? Is the priority maybe every all? The developments functions we are all functions the. Priority, but for sure for the company. So we should align on the company level. So regarding the logistic tools and the key I just shared, so we will this is the. 97 so we we need. To discuss today. 

Speaker 7 

So this is this is also to me is. 

Speaker 3 

We need to have a class. Here, so then the. Logistic is very important and it's not really so. The I I see this planning we I went on the this is the delight. For my understanding is too short. We finish all the liberation in one or two weeks, so it's crazy. We we we need to solve this this week. We can't wait for the week. 

Speaker 5 

OK, so this is. 

Speaker 3 

Also my understanding so we are delayed you believe? 

Speaker 8 

We cannot send out this. 

Speaker 3 

No, no, I mean. For those areas. We can't wait. While we delay all those after. 

Speaker 11 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

I I I want you to know that after now, yeah. Even in the high level, maybe like like yeah, the content. For example, it's a little bit in the high level and then we try to approach the supplier. 

Speaker 12 

Yeah, I think we have to. 

Speaker 3 

We can't wait for all of them. Yeah, the maturity, the, the, the, the. 

Speaker 8 

Yeah, let's talk about. 

Speaker 12 

Yes, I agree. That's what I've been pushing for. 

Speaker 10 

And send it out. 

Speaker 

As well we we just. 

Speaker 12 

Need to get that thing out. 

Speaker 3 

As if you. 

Speaker 2 

Have 80 or 90% of it. Just get. 

Speaker 7 

Help, right? Absolutely. Absolutely. OK. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, that's that's the logistic way. It's a bigger project for us with logistics, it's nothing. So that's the, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

This week I. I don't want to. Everyone. So for sure we have 250 the the the task list, but this week I will focus on the logistic and also let's understand headquarter and yes and also impact. Operating and also. Impact our profit. 

Speaker 6 

But I think the challenge. 

Speaker 2 

Guys, honestly listening to soaring as well is you, you say. Let's let's set the priorities and you know which I understand. However, the aggressivity of the timeline that we have right makes a lot of things priority. At the same time, it's not because we want to. It's not because we've chosen this right in that sense, but that's a fact. So you know where of course you're. Going to prioritize, but you won't be able to escape the fact that we are short staffed. Right #1. And #2 that we don't have robust processes in place to function efficiently. Right, these are facts. So I think closer communication for sure. Is something that's absolutely been. 

Speaker 10 

Yeah, but I I fully agree on that. But just one example, I know that's not the best, but just in one example I had the conversation with Jane and I fully trust her process and everything. Two weeks ago, I asked for that additional head. Because I judged. That it's helpful to moving forward knowing what's coming. According that, we're sticking now on that setup process. I needed to wait two weeks. Today it's not on the agenda because I was not on Friday available to provide further details because there was occupied with other things. My judgment is still there. We need that person. To to be ready. That means we're already creating for ourselves the delays and even if I want to make a shortcut, I'm not able to do that. So I need to stick on that. What we having? I will bring it up there next week. Why we need this person on board to support to meet the timelines and everything. But then I'm already if I'm counting together. Lost three weeks. 

Speaker 2 

OK. But then in in this case this? Let's set up a side meeting to clarify this thing. I don't think we need. To wait one week. 

Speaker 12 

I mean just a comment from me and the amount of work that fought us have done. We've done a great job on both contact centre and roadside assistance, but without them, there's no way I would have been able to get the level of detail that was required prior to sending out what is, you know, you know tender document in that sense. In my past life, we didn't have purchasing departments. We didn't even have a legal department in the House, but somehow we always managed to push it over the line in in quite an efficient manner and my slight concern here is that we are. We are looking for higher standards than I had in my previous company, yet we have this massive workload. And coming back to what Simon said, a lot of the contracts we're talking about. Are short term anyway. So, so the risks of tying itself into for five years or longer don't seem to be there. And I'm just wondering whether we need to have everything. Quite so well documented from the purchasing from a legal perspective, before we've even sent the document out, because inevitably whoever we sign. Two, they'll have different ways of working. So whatever documents we end up with at the beginning end, they'll need amending, adjusting tailoring to the to the ongoing discussions and that might save us some time at the beginning, yeah. I appreciate with port and things. It's probably a little bit different. But on on on some of the more general stuff maybe. 

Speaker 2 

But this coming back to priorities. And so on and so forth I think. At this point, agreements that are short-term relatively lower risk or with reputable organization, blah blah blah blah blah, we should be knocking those out. You know in no. Time right and. If we're taking a little bit of. You know, we're taking a little bit. 

Speaker 7 

What we're doing so so. 

Speaker 10 

So I already passed a lot of such contracts based on the fact that we just have a short term assignment. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah, good, good. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Recovered finance recovered. 

Speaker 4 

Coming back to this topic, should we have a little bit purchasing board or some meeting? 

Speaker 6 

We have, we have, we have Monday. 

Speaker 1 

On the regular basis. 

Speaker 3 

Meeting we have the. 

Speaker 4 

That is a PR meeting, but when it comes to these priorities, you know the priorities and decisions. 

Speaker 16 

We are pouring. 

Speaker 10 

It can be discussed on the Wednesday meetings that we have. 

Speaker 2 

But guys, we we can't. Otherwise we'll only be spending our. 

Speaker 6 

Time in meetings. 

Speaker 2 

No. So we can have 1000 meetings. So we have the PR meeting, right? Yeah. About choice, we have the supplier choice meeting right and then we have the PMO meeting on Wednesday. 

Speaker 3 

And the general evening. 

Speaker 2 

I think from A and and that doesn't include all the discussions that the business has directly with purchasing and so on and so forth, so. I think if. You can set the priorities if the business working with. Or whoever working. With purchasing or we can define those priorities. I think that's the fastest way for us right now, we. Don't need to wait now if there's issues that need to be discussed or escalated or resolved, then bring them to the Wednesday meeting, right or to our Monday, you know, meetings. Or whatever it. Is and let's put them on the table. And and resolve. Any if there's different points of view or whatever it is, right? Or somebody wants to flag if Soren says. Look, I'm uncomfortable with this because they see a higher risk. Let's discuss it there and. 

Speaker 8 

See if we're willing. 

Speaker 2 

What risk we're willing to take as an? Example I'm making it up. Now, right, but I have. 

Speaker 8 

To say we have every Friday. Only half an hour with the earlier dinner. We we really. Move a lot of things and say look, there are small things. Let's go. Let's just start. 

Speaker 7 

That is operational. That's exactly yes, but that. 

Speaker 8 

And these operational meetings are helping a lot and. The rest I. Mean we have a lot of meetings already. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, yeah, but that's my. So crack crack the things. If you've got these more operational meetings, that's where things. Should be happening. Right, not everything needs to be escalated to more formal meetings. 

Speaker 10 

The solution will be only on the working level. 

Speaker 2 

That's my point. That's my point. 

Speaker 3 

So here I I can suggest if we really. So here we have it's very difficult. We we should have this more often this task. So this one is very important if you are really agent from perspective online, just request this identification me sorry. We need to join. All this delusion. So what do you agree on? We no need the regular or purchase. But just the request this, I don't know. Identification meeting as as much as possible or as often as possible. So I'm OK then we. Start after you this is pure purchasing. It's a process. I don't want to. But for sure, for finance and legal, we will join this. So it's it's it's currently is this is. 

Speaker 2 

Everything but This is why we formalized. Also the PR. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, yeah, PR for sure. When we decided this task, then we will have formalized for the for the, for the PR here. So we decide we will buy this, then we finalize the plan then. We go for the closing. 

Speaker 2 

So you want a meeting before the PR meeting? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah, for sure. If this is aligned with, sorry, we, we can't wait the PR. So we need to have a task for task identification. Then we go for the PR. Before that we should have a pre alignment. Otherwise no one understand what's the PR because the PR is decision making. 

Speaker 10 

But this is again something we can take on the working level and just. 

Speaker 

It's not a meeting. 

Speaker 8 

It's an e-mail. It's a call. Overview So that they know the task before. 

Speaker 3 

OK. So before PR, we should have some alignment. Then we start this is. 

Speaker 7 

Anytime. Yeah. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. This is what we we are running now. It's almost like we have too many. So all the kind of the message, e-mail calling meetings and everything. But for sure we have. 

Speaker 10 

It's something we are we are doing already. 

Speaker 7 

Or trying to do. But who do you agree? 

Speaker 3 

So for sure we are supporting those. If like logistic if we have no clear so, but we still we need matriculation, we need to send out that we can't wait for four weeks or 8 weeks and now it's too late to have. 

Speaker 10 

Then then next year. 

Speaker 3 

Is also aligned with. We we need to ask you, but for sure we need to support. That's why we put out here. 

Speaker 2 

That's fine, and I think that's fine. I think your point are. From a business side, that's where an operational level that front part needs to be cracked, right? We don't need another formal meeting for a formal meeting that. That's not then. 

Speaker 8 

Only one point. Because I saw crossing tracker which. Is for me a very nice point. To see where. We are can you make? Transparent, eligible for everyone on a shared folder. That we can see. My topic now because I. Think that is? 

Speaker 9 

Think at the same point. Also with the timing timing, so make it very clear the timing and we look also at the the timing where is the deadline, where are we? 

Speaker 2 

But that Alex, that the the deadline in terms of when this is required should be defined in steps. The business decides the timing, so if. 

Speaker 9 

Correct the light. 

Speaker 11 

The residual value timeline is is already so like 2 weeks. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. Yeah, that's. 

Speaker 11 

So where are we towards that? What's the the? 

Speaker 9 

And if we are late, what will happen to the timeline? 

Speaker 11 

So we will. No, no, no. We are late. We should be. 

Speaker 2 

Late we are late. The the point is that if you put a timeline on the table right, and if you say I need to do this by I don't know 10th of. And and and from a purchasing perspective, they say we can deliver by 10th of June, then we have to deliver by 10th of June. If purchasing says it's impossible because ABC, then maybe that's something we need to discuss to see how we do it right. But once there's commitment. 

Speaker 9 

These we have are usually zeros into the the the Monday meeting when we request that activity there is a timeline. My point is this timeline and needs to be very much visualized. Because otherwise, if there is a a concern from Patrick, he needs to say OK, that is a that is a deadline. Can we make it? Cannot we make it? What is the the countermeasure? And so on. And that's we never discuss about it. 

Speaker 3 

OK, then then I I will think of how to share this certain tracker to all the teams and yeah. OK. And we we say. 

Speaker 8 

It's like asking, hey, where are we? 

Speaker 2 

We should have immediately a view on where. Everything is right. 

Speaker 7 

All the key steps exactly. 

Speaker 5 

To e-mail or calling, yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK, I understand. 

Speaker 14 

Benoit, I just wanted to say that maybe at the end of the Monday PR meeting, we can also have probably 10-15 minutes follow up on previously approved topic in this PR meeting because then there's a lot of action either from our side as business owner but also. Parking function from legal from purchasing either, you know, finalizing contracts in nature, raising PO to suppliers because this meeting it's only a kind of internal approval for us to proceed. But then the real work starts. And that's where. Today, sometimes we have some challenges. So that can help us also at the back of this meeting to visualize where we stand on what was previously agreed and approved in terms of topics and see if we are well on track or not. 

Speaker 2 

OK, that sounds reasonable. Anything else from anybody? 

Speaker 6 

Thank you. So you.
