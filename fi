Speaker 1 

OK. So from finance side, we will overall cooperate with HR and supporting the overall company on the basically the payment and reimbursement side. So basically I want to only share the first part of it. What we are doing at the moment? So basically the first thing to enable the payment. So Ebanking is critical. So after the signature from your side today I will send it back to BMP. So I hope within upcoming one week we could have the access to the E banking system at EMP. And second thing is the capital injection. I had a very good discussion last week with headquarter treasury on the overall like financing. Like basically the loan side including the capital injection and including the intercompany loan as well as the payment term. So we kind of aligned. On solution which I will like consolidate a little bit and then brief to use first independently. But anyhow we will have a good cash position at least to support our operation this year. So the capital injection I expect they this will be done actually before 20th of May. OK. And then the third part is. The agreement with GPC basically GBC is supporting us for the payment execution, so they will do the invoice checking and do the payment in the system. This is pending at the moment. For the contract agreement between the UB&GC, which I need legal support to finalize this as soon as possible. So but then basically we have the system, we have the money and we have people to support the payment process and then afterwards we will I think Joe will need to sit together with Bill to HR together as well as GBC to work on the overall payment templates and execution process and so on. And last on the list, we will do the bookkeeping with the system of GBC for the short run, because we don't have yet our own finance system in place, but I expect we will have our own by end of June or early July. And on that, this is for the payroll payment readiness and on the other hand, we're also briefly touched this topic together with HR. So last week, regarding regarding the travel agency, so staff is now using the CWT. We asked that the Asia, the responsible person whether they could include the UV. Looking into their overall framework scheme, they said this needs normally 3. So we're checking for the short run, as Joe mentioned, whether we could utilize the staff existing system and then in the, I mean at the same time to work on the independent agreement together with and so on if and on the other hand conquer was parked aside for a while. Because initially the plan was to ask GPC to basically copy paste to conquer system, that set is using to become B. But this is not. Yet started yet so worst case. Let's see whether we could utilize the existing system of that, and if not, it will be the manual reimbursement process that I will prepare as like a backup plan. So basically for the travel. Right, this is really the worst case backup plan that then. 

Speaker 16 

We need the. 

Speaker 1 

Employee to pay and then do the reimbursement and reimbursement is basically you need to collect the invoices and PC so that GC could pay you. This is like a backup plan. Now that I would prepare in parallel as well. So yeah, that's it for the preparation of the employment side. 

Speaker 8 

As long as this is not. We stay in the set environment, right? And it's possible. 

Speaker 10 

Because I I. 

Speaker 8 

Had problems with conquer, I don't know. 

Speaker 12 

I I can't get in at the moment either, so I've I've I've asked. 

Speaker 15 

That's because you're a new e-mail. 

Speaker 2 

Those of your emails. 

Speaker 8 

This is the reason, right? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, they have to roll. Back your e-mail to the e-mail and then it works. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

The other thing, Jane, we need to look. At I mean. If we're using GBC or whoever we're using. I think one of the things to do, one of the things today that I don't appreciate. In the in. The set environment is the amount of time it takes for the reimbursements to happen, right, and I think for staff who are paying out of their pocket for business expenses, taking weeks. Weeks to be repaid. You know, 3 weeks, 4 weeks. To be repaid is completely and utterly unacceptable. We don't fund the business with people's private money. That's not. How it works, yeah. I want to be. Absolutely and adamantly clear on this point. 

Speaker 1 

I mean if the. Contract will prepare with that we need to sign with GCC. Maybe I could also set up kind of the KPI metrics so. Within how many? Days they need to approve and so on. 

Speaker 8 

Jane, is there any or? In general, is there any? Option we have thought about that. We are working with company credit cards. 

Speaker 1 

I am, to be honest, not yet. Maybe we could. Look into this. I mean maybe I could. Have some talks with the weather. Could prepare and so on. 

Speaker 2 

We we need, we need. 

Speaker 1 

But still even. If the company credit card, I think we kind of need the policy to support and to what extent and for what kind of purposes that the company is allowing the employees to use the company credit card. 

Speaker 2 

And we and we need to assess it because. 

Speaker 7 

It it's it's. 

Speaker 2 

So straightforward from a softness. Compliance and things like this. It can company the. Company which can. Vary, so I think we can look at it and see how to make everybody's. Life a little bit more efficient. OK.
